> Vector AI Blockstore'r

Imagine a world where you can enter in some simple text, connect with your friends and favorite businesses, and search amongst everyone's details and get the best results. vAIber is a platform that allows you to do just that, with the added benefit of being completely open source, decentralized and self-hostable.

- Enter and search over text... even in the browser! 
- Connect to anyone using a Verifiable Long-Lived Address (VLAD), which stays the same even if you rotate your keys 
- Search for stuff without even needing to download all their data... just the index!

### Serving The App

Navigate to the platform crate of your choice:
```bash
cd web
```

and serve:

```bash
dx serve
```
